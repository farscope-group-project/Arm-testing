# Arm-testing
This project contains all the files written in testing and calibrating the arm.

The various test scripts test sending goals to the ur10 via TrajectoryPointAction and the MoveGroupCommander objects.
The launch folder contains an example of writing the launch file to bringup the ur10 and connect moveit at the same time.
